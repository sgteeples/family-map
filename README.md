# Family Map

Family Map is an application that provides a geographical view of your family history. It's an Android app with a client server architecture that I built for BYU CS 240. See [specs](https://students.cs.byu.edu/~cs240ta/fall2018/projects/family-map-server/FamilyMapServerSpecification.pdf). The tools used to make it were Java, XML, JSON, the Google Maps API, and SQLite.
